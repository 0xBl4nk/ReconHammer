# ReconHammer (!!!BETA TESTING!!!)

ReconHammer is a comprehensive automated reconnaissance workflow designed to streamline various security assessment tasks. It integrates multiple open-source tools to perform subdomain enumeration, takeover checking, CORS scanning, DNS resolution, screenshot capture, directory scanning, port scanning, service enumeration, and final report generationâ€”all in one go.

## Features

- **Customizable Parameters:**
  - `--threads <NUM>`: Set the number of threads (default: 5).
  - `--vuln`: Enable Nmap vulnerability scripts during scanning.
  - `--verbose`: Display detailed output for tools like subfinder.

- **Dependency Checks:**  
  The script ensures all required tools are installed and available in your `PATH`.

- **Integrated Recon Tools:**
  - **Subdomain Enumeration:** Uses *amass* and *subfinder*.
  - **Subdomain Takeover:** Uses *subjack*.
  - **CORS Scanning:** Runs the included `cors_scan.py` (located in `./CORScanner`).
  - **DNS Resolution:** Uses *massdns*.
  - **Screenshot Capture:** Utilizes *aquatone*.
  - **Directory Scanning:** Employs *dirsearch* (via GNU Parallel).
  - **Port Scanning:** Performs scanning with *masscan*.
  - **Service Enumeration:** Groups open ports and runs *nmap* (with optional vulnerability checks).

- **Report Generation:**  
  Creates a final HTML report that consolidates the results from all stages.

## Requirements

Before using ReconHammer, ensure the following tools and files are installed and accessible:

- **Command-Line Tools:**
  - `subfinder`
  - `subjack`
  - `massdns`
  - `aquatone`
  - `masscan`
  - `nmap`
  - `parallel` (GNU Parallel)
  - `xsltproc`
  - `jq`
  - `python3`

- **External Scripts:**
  - `./CORScanner/cors_scan.py`
  - `./dirsearch/dirsearch.py`

- **Other Files:**
  - `wordlist.txt`: Wordlist for dirsearch.

- **Included Files:**
  - -`resolvers.txt`: A list of DNS resolvers for massdns.

> **Note:** Ensure that `cors_scan.py` and `dirsearch.py` are in the correct directories (`./CORScanner/` and `./dirsearch/`, respectively).

## Usage

Run the script from the command line. It requires at least the target domain as an argument. The basic syntax is:

```
./ReconHammer.sh <domain> [--threads <NUM>] [--vuln] [--verbose]
```

### Examples

- Basic Execution:

```
./ReconHammer.sh example.com
```

- Specify Number of Threads (e.g., 10):

```
./ReconHammer.sh example.com --threads 10
```

Enable Nmap Vulnerability Scan and Verbose Output:

```
./ReconHammer.sh example.com --vuln --verbose
```


## Workflow Overview

1. Subdomain Enumeration:
    Uses amass and subfinder to generate a consolidated list of subdomains (final-subdomains.txt).

2.  Subdomain Takeover Check:
    Runs subjack to identify potential subdomain takeover vulnerabilities.

3. CORS Scanning:
    Executes the CORS scanner (cors_scan.py) against the identified subdomains.

3. DNS Resolution:
    Uses massdns to resolve subdomains into IP addresses, outputting a list (final-ips.txt).

4. Screenshot Capture:
    Captures screenshots of subdomains using aquatone.

5. Directory Scanning:
    Performs directory brute-forcing with dirsearch on both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints, running tasks in parallel.

6. Port Scanning:
    Uses masscan to scan all ports on the discovered IPs and filter for open ports.

7. Service Enumeration:
    Groups open ports by IP and uses nmap to perform detailed service enumeration (with optional vulnerability scripts).

8. Report Generation:
    Compiles all results into a final HTML report with links to the various outputs.

## Logs and Reports

- Logs:
    All execution and error logs are saved in the logs/ directory within the results folder (e.g., results_example.com/logs/workflow.log).

- Final Report:
    A consolidated HTML report (e.g., results_example.com/report.html) is generated with links to the outputs from each stage.
